          For this segment of internet Art, I decided to combine abstract art with Japandi earth colours. I wanted the user to experience the different ways and shapes that they can create using the basic shapes. This lawless interaction gives the user a canvas with shapes to explore their creative side. We have seen the new wave of modernism and minimal artworks adorning the walls of galleries and homes. There is a goal to this interaction. The goal being that I want the user to use the white space to make work that they could classify as minimal art. All it takes is a few shapes to get the mind going.

          Every great artist starts out by using the basic shapes. Circles, rectangles, triangles…the whole nine. These shapes are the base of everything you see. Your whole life is adorned by shapes, yet we don’t pay attention. Your phone, laptop, chopping board, chair, all of the things man has made has started as a simple shape. So, in this section, I have dedicated this art to shapes. No decorations, no fancy patterns, just normal shapes to get your creative gears turning.

          Internet Art is not about what the internet does for you, its about what you do with he internet.
